# password-strength-checker
I recently built a Python password strength checker as a learning project in cybersecurity.
The tool analyzes user-entered passwords and scores them based on:

Length, First Character Casing, Number of Uppercase Letters, and Symbol and Digit usage.

It then provides feedback stating that the password needs improvement with suggestions to make it better, moderate, or excellent.
